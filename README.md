# Pandora Unboxed

**Pandora Unboxed** is a personal repository documenting workflows and project-specific data analysis using Pandora spectrometer retrievals. The goal is to build a clear, organized record of scripts, notebooks, and methodology developed throughout my research.

This repository includes:

- Data conversion from raw Pandora text files into structured formats
- Time-series analysis of atmospheric measurements
- Identification of missing or incomplete observational days
- Data visualization and plotting routines
- Tools for validation of satellite-based atmospheric observations

## Background: Pandora and NASA TEMPO

The Pandora spectrometer is a ground-based instrument that retrieves surface, total column and vertical profiles of trace gases like nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), ozone (O₃), formaldehyde (HCHO), and others. Pandora data is used to validate and compare atmospheric trace gas measurements collected by satellites, specifically NASA's **TEMPO (Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution)** mission.

TEMPO provides hourly observations of air pollution across the contiguous Unite States during daylight hours from a geostationary orbit. Accurate ground-based Pandora measurements are essential for evaluating the performance of TEMPO’s satellite retrievals. This makes Pandora data critical in satellite algorithm development, calibration, and long-term environmental assessments.

## Repository Structure

This repo is organized into a series of focused tutorials. Each is self-contained and located in its own folder under the `tutorials/` directory in the `tutorials` branch.
